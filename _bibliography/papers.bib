  title={Augmented reality for training production and mounting operators},
  abstract={This master’s final project aims to purpose and develop augmented reality software applied to the industrial field, specifically to the training of production and assembly operators. To reach the objective, the most used methodologies will be studied to be able to propose the development. It is mandatory to know if is more appropriate to develop the application for Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, Mac, or some other option, such as deploying it on a smart device. Subsequently, a development of the system will be proposed and carried out, getting ready the first prototype, whether simulated or physical, and later it’ll be evaluated, modified, and all the problems that have appeared in the realization of the first prototype will be exposed. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages will be analyzed, as well as the costs and the profitability of bringing the app to the industrial market, offering it as a PaaS, a Platform-as-a-Service.},
